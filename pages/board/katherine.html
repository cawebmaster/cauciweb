				<div class="answer">
					2016
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Why did you join CA
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					My former hall mate, Helen, told me to join and become her little, 
					and so I did. Also, I wasn’t really involved in much my freshmen year, 
					so I decided it was time I tried something new. 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Why did you join board
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I really enjoyed bonding with everyone, both as a general member and an intern. 
					I’d also like to continue doing more for CA like I was able to during my intern term, 
					continue growing more in various areas, and hopefully, help others get those similar 
					experiences.

				<div class="question">

				<div class="answer">
					drawing/doing crafty tasks/watching other people draw, going on food adventures, exploring

				<div class="question">
					Favorite CA Event
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Family reveal was definitely one of my favorite events. It’s exciting to finally meet your family 
					members as well as find out what your family theme is. On top of that, you get to bond with them over food!
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Annual Event
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Family wars, which just started this year and hopefully will continue in the future, was a really memorable 
					experience for me. Once again, you get to hang out with your second family away from home, while also bonding 
					with everyone else through competitions. 
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					Favorite Memory from Ski Trip
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Sadly, since I was back in Shanghai, I didn’t get a chance to go this past year, but I’m looking forward to this year’s!
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Part of Culture Night
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Having joined dance this year with no dance experience at all, it was really rewarding when I got to perform with the rest 
					of the team. Not just that, but also getting to see the separate sections everyone had been working so hard on all year be put 
					together. The training process was also great as it gave me a chance to step out of my comfort zone (dance) and bond with people 
					I probably wouldn’t have otherwise. Seeing how much I was able to get out of joining dance this year, I’m definitely considering 
					taking part in it again this upcoming year!
