					First Year in CA
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					2016
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Why did you join CA
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I am a commuter and as a first year I knew I wouldn't meet anyone if I didn't join anything, 
					so I joined CA! It was the one club that stood out to me when I looked at a list of campus 
					organizations at the beginning of the year. After joining at Orientation, I never came out 
					to anything Fall quarter except for the roller skating after event. But then for some reason 
					I decided to go to ski trip, eventhough I didn't know anyone. And after that, 
					my whole CA experience changed. Ski trip was the reason why I came out more. The people I met are 
					the reason why I'm still here. CA gave me a little taste of what college life should be like. 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Why did you join board
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I really like the board last year and they really made such a fun environment to be in. Honestly 
					being an intern during the end of last school year (2016-2017) is what helped me decide to run for 
					board. I was really glad that I was given the opportunity to be apart of Polaris Board because being 
					able to really connect and get to know the others on board really made the experience worthwhile. I 
					wanted to join board to give back to the club and its members just the way that Polaris board did to me.

				<div class="question">
					Hobbies
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					When I'm lazy, I like to watch a lot of Youtube or Netflix, but mainly Youtube in my free time. I like 
					to watch a lot of vlogs, buzzfeed, or whatever is trending and catches my eye. I also like to watch Pretty 
					Little Liars, but the show is ending so now I need something else to watch hehe. When I'm not doing that I 
					like to play volleyball, workout, go hiking, or go on food runs. I also have a Disneyland annual pass so hit 
					me up if you have one too and ever need someone to go with :). 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite music genre and artists
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I honestly don't have a favorite music genre or artist. I'm not to big on music so I just listen to what's on 
					the radio (102.7, 97.1, 104.3, 105.9, 99.1) most of the time. The majority of the music I listen to would be Pop 
					or like mainstream music. I listen to and like most music that people play in my car, so I'm not too picky when 
					it comes to music. 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite CA Event
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					My favorite CA event would either be roller skating or ice skating. Honestly I just like doing both, even though 
					I'm not the best at either one. It's just fun to skate around and let loose (and see people fall hehe)!
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Annual Event
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Ski Trip. All I have to say is go. You'll have fun. Trust me.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Memory from Ski Trip
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					My favorite memory would probably be learning how to snowboard for the first time. Even though I barely knew anyone, 
					EVERYONE was so kind and helping those who were new to it. I honestly had so much fun going down the slopes and I can't 
					wait to go back this year! YAYY :D
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Part of Culture Night
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I was part of tech crew during culture night so I basically did lights. My favorite part about doing lights would be doing 
					it with Brittany Lee (Secretary '16-'17). Honestly hell week and the actual day of production was actually fun and I wouldn't 
					take back any of it. 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Favorite Pun
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					What do you call a cow on grass? Mulan.<br>
LOL I thought this was so funny when I first heard it. It's also funnier if you see a picture of Mulan as the answer without the word there HAHA.
