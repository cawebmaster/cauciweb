					Why did you join CA
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I was actually looking to join VSA, but CA flier'd me during the Anteater Involvement
					Fair so I ended up checking out some of their week 0 events and enjoyed the ambience and 
					people of CA a lot more :P. I joined CA because I was looking for a community and after 
					this year, they started to become my home away from home.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="question">
					Why did you join board
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Joining board was a very big decision for me. I was inspired by my big and many of the other
					board officers to join, but I also wanted to focus on AMP, my job, and academics. In the end,
					I want to do for future members what CA did for me: they gave me a family, a home, and people 
					I can rely on through thick and thin.
